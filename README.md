# Data Mesh Demo (Only Learning Purpose)

**Data Mesh Demo Project** is an implementation of the data mesh concept for learning purpose and not recommend for production use. Data Mesh is a decentralized approach that enables domain teams to perform cross-domain data analysis on their own. The domain team ingests operational data and builds analytical data models as data products to perform their own analysis. It may also choose to publish data products with data contracts to serve other domainsâ€™ data needs.
